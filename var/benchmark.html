            <p>
                In 2014, a really interesting benchmark about DI Containers for PHP was
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sitepoint.com/php-dependency-injection-container-performance-benchmarks/">published</a>
                on Sitepoint. Unfortunately, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/TomBZombie/php-dependency-injection-benchmarks">the implementation</a>
                of the tests turned out to be quite controversial, so the benchmark itself wasn't very insightful.
            </p>

            <p>
                
                I have been interested in the topic since then - and my curiosity was just growing after I had started
                to develop my own DI container, Zen - so I wanted to finally conduct a better benchmark than the last
                one was: I tried to fix its flaws while keeping its many good parts. So here is my take! If you have any
                suggestion in mind about the benchmark or you want to add your container to the list, please create an
                an <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kocsismate/php-di-container-benchmarks">issue or a Pull Request</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The examined containers are listed below along with some of their attributes:
            </p>

                    </tr>                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>
                I'll try to give a vague definition below for some of the aforementioned notions:
            </p>

            <p>
                A DI Container is <i>compiled</i> if it can be generated into a new class for production usage
                from where container entries then can be fetched. It means that your dependency graph is resolved
                during build time. This technique usually results in a very fast DIC, because there is no need for any
                Reflection or configuration when consuming the container. <i>Dynamic</i> containers
                however resolve your dependency graph Just-In-Time thus they are by design slower compared to the
                <i>compiled</i> ones.
            </p>

            <p>
                A DI Container supports <i>autowiring</i> if it can be configured to automatically inspect and
                resolve at least some non-trivial subgraphs of the full dependency graph - no matter if the resolution
                takes place build time or run time. Otherwise all dependencies have to be resolved manually which is
                probably done as configuration. In this case, a DI Container does not support <i>autowiring</i>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Essentially, dynamic containers usually need less attention during development than compiled ones,
                while containers which support autowiring usually need much less configuration than the ones without
                autowiring capabilities.
            </p>

            <p>            
                Each container is given 6 tasks (Test Suites) where they have to create or fetch object graphs of
                different sizes (10 or 100 objects). For this purpose, containers are configured either to always
                instantiate objects (this is usually called as Prototype scope or not shared services) or to instantiate
                objects only at the first retrieval and return the same instance on the subsequent calls (which is
                usually referred to as Singleton scope or shared services).
            </p>

            <p>
                There are 3 main types of Test Suites: "Cold" ones (Test Suite 1-2) measure performance including
                autoloading and startup time of containers as well as autoloading time of the retrieved objects.
                "Semi-Warm" ones (Test Suite 3-4) measure performance excluding container autoloading time, but
                including startup time and autoloading time of the retrieved objects, while "Warm" ones (Test Suite 5-6)
                exclude autoloading and startup time equally. Time of compilation is always excluded from the results
                due to OPcache.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each Test Suite contains three Test Cases which define the number of iterations the main task has to be
                repeated in order to simulate real world usage patterns. This number ranges from 10 to 10 000.
                Furthermore, all Test Cases are performed 30 times (this is referred to as "runs") in order to improve
                the accuracy of measurements. The median of these results are displayed in the final results.
            </p>

            <p>
                The benchmark is run on a 15-inch MacBook Pro from 2015 using PHP 7.1 with OPcache enabled and autoloader
                optimized (using authoritative mode). During the measurements, a PHP-FPM script served by nginx is
                executed each time. This is needed because a production environment is simulated much better this way
                than in the CLI.
            </p>

            <p>
                The examined DI Containers are configured for production usage as if it was probably done in case of a
                big project. That's why I took advantage of autowiring capabilities when possible. Unfortunately, this
                discriminates some participants giving them a big handicap, but I wanted to measure container
                performance with a configuration as advertised or recommended by the documentation and most probable
                to be used in the real world.

            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

            <p>
                My hypothesis was that different types of containers have significantly different performance
                characteristics. It can be concluded by looking at the results that the hypothesis can't be rejected as
                it seems that the more user-friendly a container is (dynamic &gt; compiled, dynamic with autowiring
                &gt; dynamic without autowiring) the slower it is, especially in tasks where object instantiation is
                measured (Test Suites 3-4).
            </p>

            <p>
                However, keep in mind that in a well-architected application you won't call your DI Container
                hundreds or even thousands of times because ideally there should be only one
                <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2011/07/28/CompositionRoot/">composition root</a>:
                when you invoke the controller(s) which handle(s) the request (but there is a good chance
                of needing the container in other places of the application layer - e.g. in your middleware or bootstrap
                files). That's why most results are exaggerated - you probably won't see milliseconds of difference
                between the fastest and the slowest DIC in the real life.
            </p>

            <p>
                To sum up, when choosing a container it only depends on your needs which one suits your project best:
                if you have a performance-critical application then you probably want to choose a compiled container.
                If maximum performance is not required, but you develop a big and complex system then I would recommend
                a dynamic container with autowiring capabilities. Otherwise you can go with simpler containers.
